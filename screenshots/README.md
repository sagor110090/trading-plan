<!-- PWA Screenshots Placeholder -->

This directory should contain the following PWA screenshots:
- desktop.png (1280x720) - Wide form factor screenshot
- mobile.png (375x812) - Narrow form factor screenshot

These screenshots are used in app stores and PWA installation prompts to showcase the app's interface.

You can take screenshots of the running application and resize them accordingly.

The app will work without these screenshots, but they provide better presentation in app stores and installation prompts.
